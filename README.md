# Docker Integration

Control Docker from within Python scripts.
Set-up and tear-down for integration tests.

## Installation

```python
pip install dockerintegration
```


## TODO

- Test set-up
- Control docker in python
- POSSIBLY put them in an interface -> class
- docker-compose up
- docker-compose stop
- get service address
- wait until up for services - optional, may depend on service
- need temporary 'projects' - throw them away
- parallel execution
- Specify docker-compose.yml file to use, base dir etc
- Docker should not have to be running to run tests
- Get docker details from env variables
- Needs to be somewhat independent in terms of Docker versions
